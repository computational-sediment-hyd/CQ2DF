CQ2DF - Cross section Quasi 2D Flow Model

====

CQ2DF is numerical simulation model that calculates simply flow velocity distribution in cross section of river.

## Description

 - CQ2DF is numerical simulation model that calculates the flow velocity distribution by Reynolds equation in x direction ignoring the differential term of x by assuming a uniform channel

 - Parameters are only river bed slope and equivalent roughness.

 - A Cartesian grid is used.
